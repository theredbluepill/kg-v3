# Rust Rules Engine Reference

This document is the current map for the Rust Orbit Wars simulator. The Python
reference is the installed `kaggle_environments.envs.orbit_wars.orbit_wars`
module. Resolve the exact local module path and gameplay prose path with:

```sh
uv run python -c 'from importlib import import_module; from pathlib import Path; m = import_module("kaggle_environments.envs.orbit_wars.orbit_wars"); print(Path(m.__file__).resolve()); print(Path(m.__file__).with_name("README.md").resolve())'
```

## Assumptions

- The Rust simulator is the inner rules API. It receives typed actions and fails
  fast on invalid API inputs.
- Fail-fast means invalid typed/manual inputs may panic after earlier mutations
  in the same call. The simulator does not provide transactional rollback for
  impossible action sets because valid generated/RL states are the hot path.
- Python/Kaggle-compatible action parsing stays outside the simulator.
- Floating-point state uses `f64`. Parity tests compare floats with
  `math.isclose`-style tolerances, while ids, owners, ship counts, removals, and
  other discrete state match exactly. Global termination and final win/loss
  must match exactly, while nonterminal eliminated-player status intentionally
  differs as described below.
- Procedural generation does not need to match from the same integer seed across
  Python and Rust RNGs. It should match when driven by the same stream of random
  integers/floats. The `RandomSource::uniform` contract follows Python's
  inclusive `random.uniform(a, b)` endpoint behavior, including `a == b`.
- The engine supports both 2-player and 4-player games from the start.

## Primary Gameplay API

The primary Rust gameplay entry points are:

```rust
pub fn reset(config: ResetConfig) -> State;
pub fn step(state: &mut State, actions: &[PlayerAction]) -> StepResult;
```

Deterministic fixture and test variants with injected random sources or comet
data are also public, as are player ship-score and alive-flag helpers. The
`generation` and `state` modules expose the lower-level types used by these
entry points.

`State` owns planets, fleets, comet metadata, the current step, the player
count, generation constants, and ids needed for deterministic progression.
Planets and initial planets are stored in ID-indexed slots (`PlanetVector`,
backed by `Vec<Option<Planet>>`) so direct ID lookup is the normal path.
Planet IDs must be unique and less than `MAX_PLANET_ID = 100`; removed comet
planets leave empty slots. Generated/reset states also cache orbiting planet
positions across the episode horizon and blocker-safe
static-source/static-target launch angles plus static-safe target arcs in an
ID-indexed contiguous cache for RL target decoding. Fully blocker-covered
static targets do not receive cached fallback angles, so `full_mask` masks them
out of the legal target set.
Manually constructed or replay-loaded states may leave those caches empty
because core rules progression still derives orbit positions from
`initial_planets`, `angular_velocity`, and `step`.

`StepResult` returns one result per actual player: active, won, or lost. It also
returns auxiliary counters for fleets and ships removed by the sun or by leaving
the board, fleets removed during planet/combat resolution, ships removed during
combat resolution, plus the number of planets and comet planets captured during
the step. Neutral planet and comet arrivals also count successful captures and
undershoots separately for RL terminal undershot-rate metrics. This matches the
actual player count without making 2-player games carry ignored entries. Orbit
Wars' Python reference leaves nonterminal eliminated players in Kaggle `ACTIVE`
status until global termination; this simulator intentionally marks those
players `Lost` immediately so the RL adapter can emit early loss/done signals
before widening results to fixed outer player slots for tensor observations,
rewards, and dones.

Terminal win/loss is decided by total per-player ship count (planets plus
fleets, neutral excluded). `player_ship_scores` exposes that per-player tally so
the RL adapter can derive ship-count-based terminal rewards (see the RL API
spec's reward modes) without recomputing ownership.

## Current Status

Implemented:

- Rust state/action/config/result types.
- Reset and procedural generation with injectable random sources.
- Turn stepping in Python reference order.
- Focused Rust unit tests for rules components.
- Generation parity over ignored Python-reference fixtures.
- Replay parity over ignored Kaggle JSONL fixtures.
- Python RL observation/action wrappers and vectorized environment.
- Mechanical mapped-doc freshness checks through `just docs-fresh`.

Open follow-up work:

- Benchmarks and data-structure optimization for training throughput.
- CI-owned parity fixture cache or checked-in minimal parity fixtures.

## Rules-Change Workflow

For rules changes, work in this order:

1. Update or add parity/unit tests that state the expected behavior.
2. Change the Rust simulator or fixture generator.
3. Update this reference and `docs/rules-parity-coverage.md` in the same change.
4. Run `just rs-prepare` with parity fixtures present. Use
   `REQUIRE_PARITY_FIXTURES=0 just rs-test` only when intentionally skipping
   fixture-backed parity.
5. Use a reviewer pass to compare behavior against the Python reference and call
   out drift.

Human review should focus on acceptance criteria and rule interpretation. Agents
should own implementation, test updates, and documentation corrections.

## Test Strategy

Start with component tests:

- Geometry: distance and point-to-segment distance.
- Fleet speed curve.
- Planet generation helpers driven by an injectable random source.
- Comet path generation driven by an injectable random source.
- Python-reference generation fixtures for planet and comet generation, so Rust
  must consume the same recorded random calls and match Python's generated
  outputs.
- Planet generation follows the current Python reference phases directly:
  random static groups first, then random fill groups until the target count and
  at least one orbiting group are present.
- Home assignment picks any symmetric group for both 2-player and 4-player
  games; current fixtures no longer require a y=x diagonal group.
- Action validation and launch side effects.
- Production.
- Fleet movement, out-of-bounds removal, sun collision, planet collision.
- Simultaneous fleet-vs-planet and fleet-vs-comet swept-pair collisions.
- Combat resolution, including tied attackers and same-owner reinforcement.
- Termination and scoring.

Replay parity tests:

- Download Kaggle replays directly into compact JSONL fixtures containing
  normalized numeric action triples, per-player Kaggle status/reward, and
  post-step reference observations.
- Use `steps[t - 1][0].observation` as the transition input, actions from
  `steps[t][player].action`, and `steps[t][0].observation` as the canonical
  expected state.
- Keep replay fixture downloads out of Git. Download `replay-<episode-id>.jsonl`
  files to the fixture directory or repo root, where `.gitignore` excludes them.
- `scripts/download_replays.py` writes one JSONL row per transition:
  `episode_id`, `players`, `step`, normalized per-player action triples,
  per-player Kaggle `results`, the pre-step observation, and the canonical
  post-step player 0 observation.
- `scripts/regenerate_test_fixtures.sh` removes outdated replay fixtures,
  regenerates the Python generation fixture, and downloads the selected replay
  fixture set.
- Keep fixture files out of Git and make tests print the regeneration command
  when required fixtures are missing.
- Replay parity tests discover all `replay-*.jsonl` files in
  `ORBIT_WARS_PARITY_FIXTURE_DIR`, or
  `tests/fixtures/orbit_wars_replays` by default. If no fixtures are present,
  the test fails by default. Set `REQUIRE_PARITY_FIXTURES=0` to skip replay
  parity, including when local replay fixtures are present but intentionally
  stale. When rules change without replacing the reference episode set, leave
  replay test code unchanged. When replacing episodes, update
  `REQUIRED_REPLAY_COVERAGE` in `src/rules_engine/replay_tests.rs` with each
  episode id, player count, and row count, and update the episode lists below,
  in the README, and in `docs/rules-parity-coverage.md`.
- Replay parity validates the required documented coverage set in
  `src/rules_engine/replay_tests.rs`: episode id, player count, and transition
  row count must match the list below so coverage cannot silently shrink.

The current downloaded reference episodes are:

- `75930761`: 2-player, 103 recorded transitions.
- `75926553`: 4-player, 222 recorded transitions.

## Maintenance Rules

- Treat this file as a current-state map. When a listed implementation step is
  completed, move it into `Current Status` or remove it.
- Any rules-engine change should update this file and
  `docs/rules-parity-coverage.md`, or explicitly state why no docs changed in
  the PR checklist.
- Regenerate Python-reference generation fixtures with
  `scripts/regenerate_test_fixtures.sh` when upstream generation changes.
- Run `just rs-prepare` after Rust edits and `just py-prepare` after Python
  edits.

## Known Risk Areas

- Python `random` parity is intentionally not required from integer seed alone.
- Python silently ignores malformed Kaggle actions; Rust should not mirror this
  at the typed simulator boundary.
- Comets are inserted as planets at off-board placeholder positions and expire
  both before launches and immediately after movement.
- Planet movement uses `initial_planets` as the orbital anchor, not last turn's
  position.
- Manual states with duplicate planet IDs or planet IDs at/above
  `MAX_PLANET_ID` panic during state construction.
- Public Rust state/config structs are optimized for tests and fixture
  injection, not for defensive construction. Constructors establish supported
  2-player/4-player and ID invariants; hand-built invalid structs may panic in
  later fixed-size indexed paths instead of being rejected up front.
- Manual planet owners must be neutral (`-1`) or within `0..player_count`, and
  manual fleet owners must be within `0..player_count`; result, alive-player,
  and combat paths panic with explicit owner messages when malformed states
  violate those bounds.
- Four-player home assignment chooses among any symmetric group, using the
  reference RNG stream after planet generation.
- Planet and comet end-of-tick positions are planned before fleet movement.
  Fleet collision checks use the reference swept-pair predicate over the fleet
  segment and the planet/comet segment for that tick, then planet/comet
  movement is applied and combat is resolved. `StepResult.fleets_lost_in_combat`
  counts fleets removed during planet/combat resolution, and
  `StepResult.ships_lost_in_combat` counts ships destroyed by fleet-vs-fleet
  and fleet-vs-planet combat resolution; sun and out-of-bounds losses remain in
  `FleetLossStats`. Neutral undershot counters are based on the post
  fleet-vs-fleet surviving incoming force: if it fails to exceed neutral planet
  or comet ships, it is an undershot; if it exceeds them, it is a successful
  neutral capture for the rate denominator.
- Fleet movement queues swept planet/comet collisions before checking
  out-of-bounds or sun removal, matching the reference behavior for fast fleets
  that cross multiple collision/removal zones in one step.
- Termination happens at `episodeSteps - 2`, which is earlier than the prose
  rule's 500-turn wording suggests.
- Player 0 observations are the canonical replay observations. Later player
  observations may omit `step`.

## Kaggriculture root feature integration

Task 1.3 adds the standalone pinned `engine_rs` package as a root path dependency.
Its `serde_json/arbitrary_precision` and `preserve_order` features are now shared
with Orbit. The test-only `RandomCall::Uniform` fixture fields deserialize through
`serde_json::Number` and reject non-finite conversions. A literal decimal regression
passed before unification, failed afterward, then passed with this repair. Production
Orbit generation and comparison tolerances are unchanged. The native observation
writer lives entirely in root `src/kaggriculture/`; the kernel remains byte-pinned.
Its config-bound wrapper uses the public snapshot API and forwards stepping only.
Exact fields, strict tiles and both-seat privacy checks are observation coverage,
not new Python-engine rules parity. Task 1.3 receipts, including the qualified
512-state oracle and the pending pod timing, are in `ops/rebuild-2026-09-29/1.3/`.
Contract v4.1 retires the temporary `engine_rs/tests/grammar_kernel.rs` bridge
at the first production root-to-engine dependency, which Task 1.3 creates. That
test still exists; moving it into root integration is left to Task 1.4.
